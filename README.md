# Capstone_Project1

## Bay Area Housing

This respository contains files and folders for my first capstone project of Springboard's Data Science Career Track course. It focuses on housing prices/cost of living in the Bay Area using Zillow data. See "Capstone_Project_1_Proposal.pdf" for more details.

The goal of this project is to develop a model that could reasonably predict the future housing market for the San Francisco Bay Area. This model could help visualize and influence how the market is impacted. If you'd like to find out more behind the motivation of this project, it could be found in the Capstone Project 1 Proposal document above.
